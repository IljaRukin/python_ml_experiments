    "A classification tree splits the data using features of the data into groups. For example we can classify plant species by size and shape of their flowers. The classification tree consists of multiple nodes, each with a question (e.g. flower diameter >5cm or color yellow) with a yes or no answer. After answering all question you get to a leaf node wich tells you the classification result (e.g. sunflower). <br>\n",
    "To build such a tree we start with a (training) dataset composed of many features (properties of the plant) and the classification result (plant type). Then the nodes are computed to split the data. Usually a greedy approach is used, since it's impossible to search all possible combination of splits for the best one. In each step the group is split into two groups using all possible splitting parameters, and the best split parameter is chosen by some criterium (impurity,information gain,error).\n",

The decision tree is constructed with multiple filters and the objective to split the data as accurate as possible into positive and negative examples.\n",

It can also give rise to many small splits and therefore overfitting. We want the data on the contrary to be split in roughly equally sized chunks wich results in a minimal nuber of nodes. This also gives us a high information gain and purity of the data with each split. Therefore these other metrics are prefered. <br>\n",
